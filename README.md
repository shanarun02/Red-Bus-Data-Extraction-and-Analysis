# Red-Bus-Data-Extraction-and-Analysis
Automated redBus data extraction using Selenium, followed by data cleaning, analysis with Pandas, and interactive visualization through a Streamlit app. The project displays bus operator details, timings, prices, and ratings, offering an insightful user-friendly dashboard.
🚌 Red Bus Data Extraction and Analysis
This project automates the extraction of bus service data from the redBus website using Selenium. The extracted data is processed and analyzed using Pandas, and an interactive dashboard is built using Streamlit for easy exploration and visualization.

📌 Project Description
The goal of this project is to scrape important bus details like operator name, departure time, arrival time, bus type, price, and user ratings from redBus.in.
Once the data is extracted, it is cleaned, structured, and analyzed to gain insights such as:

Most frequent bus operators

Price variations across operators

Popular bus types (AC/Non-AC, Sleeper, Semi-Sleeper)

Average departure and arrival patterns

Rating trends based on operators

Finally, all the data and insights are visualized through an easy-to-use Streamlit application where users can:

View complete bus lists

Filter by operator, price range, or bus type

Explore trends and charts for better decision-making
